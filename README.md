If you thought you couldn't know what a historical emperor such as Julius Caesar had to say, you definitely were wrong. 
This small project recollects 2,500 years ago's quotes brought to the present!.

Julius Caesar's quotes is the implementation of the Caesar API (see [this repo](https://github.com/iamciro/caesar-api)) and randomly generates quotes from this very famous Roman Emperor.
